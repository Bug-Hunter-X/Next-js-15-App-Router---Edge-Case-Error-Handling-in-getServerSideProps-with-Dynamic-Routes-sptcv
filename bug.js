In Next.js 15, a particularly uncommon bug can arise when using the `app` directory's new features alongside custom server-side rendering logic and dynamic routes.  The issue might manifest as unexpected behavior or complete failure if data fetching within a `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` function, intended for a specific dynamic route segment, isn't properly handled for edge cases. For example, suppose a route like `/product/[id]` fetches data based on `id`. If the `id` leads to a non-existent product, the error handling within `getServerSideProps` might be inadequate to prevent the entire app from crashing or returning an incorrect response, especially when interacting with external APIs or databases. This frequently involves improper error handling, leading to exceptions not caught by Next.js's default error handling mechanisms.
